Final PJ about Geo-based Twitter Analysis

Predicting interactions between objects in a heterogeneous information network is a significant task in social network analysis. Recently, the rapid development of social networking platforms and the pervasive use of mobile phones have greatly promoted the study of location-based social analysis. In this essay, we study the heterogeneous network which is composed of locations and social networks of users extracted from Twitter. After calculating basic properties of our dataset, we detect communities, build recommendation systems, and study the trajectory of a representative user in this paper.
